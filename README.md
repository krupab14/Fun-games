VB.NET Game Collection
Welcome to my VB.NET Game Collection repository! This project contains two simple yet engaging games that I developed during my diploma program. As my first-ever project, it holds a special place in my journey as a developer.

Games Included:
Tic Tac Toe: Test your strategic skills in this classic game of Xs and Os. Play against a friend or challenge the computer for a match!

Maze Game: Navigate through a challenging maze, testing your reflexes and problem-solving abilities. See if you can reach the end without getting lost!

Getting Started:
To get started with these games, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in your preferred VB.NET IDE. From there, you can explore the code, make modifications, or even enhance the games with new features!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback. Enjoy playing!
